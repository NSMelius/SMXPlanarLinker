This is sample code for linking 3D inputs from a 3DConnexion SpaceMouse to ADS symbols in a TwinCAT PLC run-time
## About This Repository
This repository is for sample code written by [Beckhoff Automation LLC.](https://www.Beckhoff.com). It used the ADS API to read symbol information from a PLC run-time and write values from an input device. 

This sample code uses a deprecated version of the SpaceMouse SDK provided by [3DConnexion](www.3DConnexion.com). Although deprecated, it is still compatible with version 10.7.3 of the driver.
